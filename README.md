# GreatHikes
This is based upon the Web Developer BootCamp by Colt Steele. I did use Bootstrap 4. The photos are all ones that I have taken during many of my hikes in the Southwest US over the last 8 years. While 
people are welcome to log in and create comments. It's mostly just about being a solid first completed project. Thanks to Ian Schoonover for helping me get it to the finish line 
and Zarko for his help while I was doing the online BootCamp.
